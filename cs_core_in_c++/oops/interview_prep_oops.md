# OOP_Prep
C++ practice project for mastering Object-Oriented Programming concepts for SDE interviews.

## Features / Requirements:

- [ ] Classes & Objects
    - [ ] Implement a basic class with private members
    - [ ] Add constructors and destructors
    - [ ] Methods to manipulate/access data (getters/setters)
    - [ ] Instantiate objects and test behavior

- [ ] Inheritance & Polymorphism
    - [ ] Single, multilevel, and hierarchical inheritance
    - [ ] Method overriding
    - [ ] Virtual functions and dynamic dispatch
    - [ ] Method overloading (compile-time polymorphism)
    - [ ] Base class pointer to derived class object usage

- [ ] Encapsulation & Abstraction
    - [ ] Hide data members using private/protected
    - [ ] Provide public getters/setters
    - [ ] Abstract base class with pure virtual functions
    - [ ] Concrete derived class implementation

- [ ] Composition & Aggregation
    - [ ] Implement "HAS-A" relationship using member objects
    - [ ] Composition vs Aggregation differences
    - [ ] Test lifetime dependencies between objects

- [ ] Interfaces & Abstract Classes
    - [ ] Define abstract classes / interfaces
    - [ ] Implement multiple interfaces in a derived class
    - [ ] Show polymorphic usage

- [ ] Design Principles (SOLID)
    - [ ] Single Responsibility
    - [ ] Open/Closed
    - [ ] Liskov Substitution
    - [ ] Interface Segregation
    - [ ] Dependency Inversion

- [ ] Exception Handling
    - [ ] Throw and catch exceptions
    - [ ] Try-catch-finally pattern
    - [ ] Custom exception classes
    - [ ] Propagate exceptions properly

- [ ] Object Lifecycle & Memory Management
    - [ ] Stack vs Heap allocation
    - [ ] RAII using constructors/destructors
    - [ ] Smart pointers: unique_ptr, shared_ptr
    - [ ] Manage object ownership and avoid leaks

- [ ] Design Patterns (Common)
    - [ ] Singleton
    - [ ] Factory
    - [ ] Observer
    - [ ] Strategy
    - [ ] Adapter / Decorator
    - [ ] Practice small examples using patterns

- [ ] UML & System Design Using OOP
    - [ ] Draw class diagrams for a simple system
    - [ ] Identify relationships: inheritance, composition, aggregation
    - [ ] Translate requirements to classes and methods
    - [ ] Implement small prototype from UML

## ToDo / Bonus

- [ ] Unit tests in C++
- [ ] Integrate with CMake for build
- [ ] Combine multiple concepts in mini-projects
- [ ] Optimize memory and performance in implementations
- [ ] Apply advanced patterns in examples

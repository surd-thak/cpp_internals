| ---- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | **Processes & Threads**                 | Core of multitasking; interviews test concurrency    | Process vs Thread, PCB, context switching, thread lifecycle, multi-threaded design, pros/cons of threads                |
| 2    | **CPU Scheduling**                      | Critical for understanding performance & fairness    | FCFS, SJF, Priority, Round Robin, Multilevel Queue, preemption, starvation, response time, throughput                  |
| 3    | **Synchronization & Concurrency**       | Tests problem-solving skills                         | Mutex, Semaphore, Deadlock (conditions, detection, prevention), Race Conditions, Critical Section, Producer-Consumer |
| 4    | **Deadlocks**                           | Often asked as reasoning question/scenario           | Necessary & sufficient conditions, Resource Allocation Graph, Deadlock prevention/avoidance, Banker's algorithm       |
| 5    | **Memory Management**                   | Important for system design questions                | Paging, Segmentation, Virtual Memory, TLB, Page Replacement (LRU, LFU, Clock, FIFO, Optimal), Fragmentation           |
| 6    | **File Systems & I/O**                  | Key for understanding storage and system calls      | File descriptors, File metadata, Open/close/read/write, Disk scheduling (FCFS, SSTF, SCAN), Caching/Buffering        |
| 7    | **Virtual Memory & Paging**             | Shows deep problem-solving ability                   | Address translation, Page Tables, Multi-level Paging, TLB, Page Fault Handling, Swapping                                |
| 8    | **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**   | Tests concurrency reasoning                           | Pipes, Message Queues, Shared Memory, Sockets, Signals, Race conditions in IPC                                         |
| 9    | **Deadlocks & Livelocks (Threads/OS)**  | Often scenario-based                                  | Real-life scenario reasoning, resource allocation, avoiding livelocks                                                 |
| 10   | **System Calls & Kernel vs User Space** | Understanding OS boundaries & abstraction            | Program-OS interaction, Privilege levels, System call mechanism, Context switching                                      |

Multithreading → your program using multiple “mini-workers” (threads).

Concurrency → switching between tasks quickly so several tasks make progress. It is concept of multiple independent tasks.
    --Async mode gives concurrency; deferred gives lazy execution
    --Concurrency in C++ can come from manual threads, async tasks, or even one thread running many tasks — all allow multiple operations to make progress independently.

Parallelism → multiple CPU cores doing tasks at the exact same time.

Synchronization → making sure threads don’t interfere with each other while sharing data.
